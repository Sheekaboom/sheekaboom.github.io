# Hello /\*cruel\*/ World!

So I am not sure when you are reading this post, but the world right now is figurative and literal in flames.

The year 2020 began seeming like any other year. 2019 ended relatively uneventful. We had all heard of 'some new virus' that was causing china all sorts of problems. China is really far away... Everyone sort of figured it
just wouldnt be an issue. January and February passed with coronavirus causing more issues in europe, but there were still very minimal cases in the US.
