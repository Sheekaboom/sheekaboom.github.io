Im an ee, my take on how getting into web design went.

- Static vs CMS (content management system)

- Domain, hosting, etc

- started with jquery and static site

- moved away from jquery
    - CSS provides almost anything youd need

- while backward compatability is nice, who is the target audience?
    - for me more computer savvy people

- Using javascript modules

- CDNs are your friend

- CSS3 provides a ton of functionality

- definitely still a beginner at this

- Web customization tools
    - theming
    - word filtering (using regex)

- Jekyll (or other site building programs)
