      text: "We will begin by cutting all of the required size lumber needed for the stand. While I used a circular saw for this step, I must say that I really wished I'd had a miter saw. This is especially useful for the 4x4 lumber because my circular saw cant cut deep enough to make it through in a single cut.",

        { text: Cut 5 x 20” pieces from the 2”x6” lumber (or 18” length if you don't want the top surface to overhang) },
        { text: Cut 3 x 18” pieces from the 2”x6” lumber },
        { text: Cut 4 x 18” pieces from the 2”x3” lumber (an 8’ board will produce 4 x 18” pieces plus a single board just about 23.5” after accounting for the kerf) },
        { text: Cut 4 x 23.5” pieces from the 2”x3” lumber },

    text: "Now we will take the pieces we cut out in the last step and assemble the frame of the stand. Here we could drill pilot holes to be exact, but self tapping deck screws and a driver make quick work of the assembly.",
    directions: [
        { text: Connect 2 x (2”x3”x23.5”) beams between the legs (4”x4”x26.5” pieces) flush with (or slightly above) the top of the 4”x4” beams at a 23.5” distance to create two sides. },
        { text: Add 2 x (2”x3”x24”) to each of the sides at a height of 1.5” inches from the bottom of the 4”x4” beams. },
        { text: Connect each of these sides at an 18” distance by 2 x (2”x3”x18”) pieces at a height of 12” },
        { text: Add 2 x (2”x3”x18”) pieces just below the (2”x3”x23.5”) sections added in part A }
    ]},

    { name: Create the Flat Surfaces,
    image: /projects/carpentry/small_grill_stand/propane_shelf.png,
    text: "With the frame together, we can now create our top surface for the grill bottom shelf which will hold the propane bottle. Again some self tapping deck screws and a driver make quick work of this job.",
    directions: [
        { text: Add 3 x (2”x3”x18”) across the 24” span at the bottom of the frame to create a flat surface between the legs.},
        { text: Add 5 x (2”x3”x18”) across the top of the frame. It is recommended these are only screwed into the (2”x3”x23.5”) cross-beams and NOT the 4”x4” legs. This provides for easier dissasembly for moving}

    text: "This may just be the hardest step of the whole project... (This is sarcasm if that didn't make it across) You now have to place your grill on your beautiful new stand! A standard propane tank should fit nicely on the bottom shelf of the stand. While it is definitely optional, during this step I also added a bottle opener and some hook screws to mine to allow me to hang my grilling utensils and have a nice cold beer without having to go inside. These can be seen in the final product and should be placed wherever they fit best for your setup!",

So I live in a very small apartment. We have a deck and are allowed to have grills, but the size of the deck really prohibits a full size grill.
I recently then bought the small and portable Weber Q1200 grill and I love it. It is robust, reliable and cooks very well.
While I sometimes wish I had multiple burners (one of the only cons of the grill I've noticed so far), it works very well for me and my SO.
The one problem was that I either had to grill on the ground (it hurts the back a bit) or buy the $80 grill stand for the Q1200.
Instead, I decided to build a low cost solid wood grill stand for about $40. It has been amazing to have and allowed me to add some personal touches (like the optional bottle opener).

Here we have the instructions and some design files for this grill stand. 
Feel free to download any files and try building it yourself! 
As always I would also love to hear any critisisms (ideally constructive), questions, or other ideas/modifications you may have made on your own.
