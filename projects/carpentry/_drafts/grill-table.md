A standard propane tank should fit nicely on the bottom shelf of the stand. While it is definitely optional, during this step I also added a bottle opener and some hook screws to mine to allow me to hang my grilling utensils and have a nice cold beer without having to go inside. These can be seen in the final product and should be placed wherever they fit best for your setup!",

So I live in a very small apartment. We have a deck and are allowed to have grills, but the size of the deck really prohibits a full size grill.
I recently then bought the small and portable Weber Q1200 grill and I love it. It is robust, reliable and cooks very well.
While I sometimes wish I had multiple burners (one of the only cons of the grill I've noticed so far), it works very well for me and my SO.
The one problem was that I either had to grill on the ground (it hurts the back a bit) or buy the $80 grill stand for the Q1200.
Instead, I decided to build a low cost solid wood grill stand for about $40. It has been amazing to have and allowed me to add some personal touches (like the optional bottle opener).

Here we have the instructions and some design files for this grill stand. 
Feel free to download any files and try building it yourself! 
As always I would also love to hear any critisisms (ideally constructive), questions, or other ideas/modifications you may have made on your own.
