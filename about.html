      <h1>About Me</h1> 

      <p>
      I am an electrical engineer by training who loves learning new things. 
      My work interests are in embedded systems, electromagnetic design and test, and high performance computing.
      Outside of work I love carpentry along with playing in the great outdoors.
      </p>

      <h2>Learn</h2>
      <p>
      I completed by bachelors degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 2017.
      During my time in undergrad, much of my schooling focused on embedded system design.
      I loved the idea of being able to take a bare metal processor and be able to make it perform all sorts of cool tasks.
      During this time, I also found a lot of interest in using embedded systems for personal health tracking.
      Because of this, I did a few projects during this time developing personal electrocardiogram (ECG) systems.
      Over the course of my undergrad I also participated in undergraduate research to accelerate full wave electromagnetic propogation using a finite difference time domain method (FDTD).
      This is where I grew my love for high performance computing with programming tools such as Nvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) for graphics processors and message passing interface (MPI) for clustered computing systems.

      The August following my undergraduate degree, I began my graduate degree at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado.
      At the same time, I also began as a graduate researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
      My studies in graduate school quickly turned to almost exclusively electromagnetics. 
      This included both test and measurement with NIST, along with graduate courses in design and simulation at school.

      I recieved my Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in December 2018.
      Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Colorado School of Mines while continuing working at NIST.
      My current research is focused on novel 5G millimeter-wave channel estimators using Monte-Carlo Techniques and High Performance Computing.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
      While I am not great with some of the more visual aspects of design, I do love engineering design.
      This includes everything from PCB design to Software to furniture design. I have designed and built a number of 
      projects in both of these areas. More information and step by step tutorials on each of my projects 
      can be found under the <a href='#'>projects</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Adventure</h2>
      <p>
      A lot of my life does revolve around my love for learning and design. 
      Around all of this, I like to try and get outside and explore the outdoors.
      During the winter, I am an avid snowboarder who has recently found a passion for splitboarding.
      In the summer, I enjoy biking, hiking, and camping.
      I also enjoy canyoneering in Utah. Some of my favorites out there include slot canyons in Escalante and Zion.
      Recently I have picked back up SCUBA diving which was something I originally started when I was about 12.
